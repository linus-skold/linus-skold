# About Me 
Hello there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Linus and I'm a passionate programmer who's always looking for a challenge.  
I've previously worked with game development using C/C++, Node, Python and more before I moved to the web development world to make use of NodeJS, TypeScript and React among other tools.  
My heart still burns for games and I play a lot in my spare time while trying to make a game, constantly switching between Godot & building my own engine.
